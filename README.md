Decentralized package manager based on git and pacman. Accumulates power of both `git` and `pacman` to provide easier way to create arch packages and distribute them using git links.

üíø Single line installation script:

```sh
git clone https://fmnx.io/core/pack && cd pack && makepkg --noconfirm -sfri
```

üêã You can use `pack` with docker:

```
docker run --rm -it fmnx.io/core/pack --help
```

You can use env variables to configure pack behaviour in docker:

- `PACK_ALLOW_AUR` - automatically try downloading packages from AUR if they are not found in pacman repositories
- `PACK_REMOVE_GIT_REPOS` - remove git repositories after installation
- `PACK_REMOVE_BUILT_PACKAGES` - don't cache built `.pkg.tar.zst` packages
- `PACK_DISABLE_PRETTYPRINT` - disable colors in CLI output
- `PACK_DEBUG_MODE` - watch every system call execution

Also you can modify `pack` configuration in `~/.pack/config.yml`.

### üöÄ Features:

- Install and update packages using git links (also allows to install AUR packages)
- Compatability with all arch based distros
- Simple to write configuration - `.pack.yml`

Configuration example for flutter project:

```yml
# Dependencies, that are required for project at runtime.
run-deps:
  - vlc
# Dependencies, that are required to build project.
build-deps:
  - flutter
  - clang
  - cmake
# Scripts, that would be executed in root directory to get build files.
scripts:
  - flutter build linux
# File mapping for resulting build files and directories from project root
# to resulting file system.
# Each file or folder will be installed as it is mapped in this file.
mapping:
  assets/logo.png: /usr/share/icons/hicolor/512x512/apps/flutter-fmnx-package.png
  flutter-fmnx-package.sh: /usr/bin/flutter-fmnx-package
  flutter_fmnx_package.desktop: /usr/share/applications/flutter-fmnx-package.desktop
  build/linux/x64/release/bundle: /usr/share/flutter-fmnx-package
```

Configuration example for go cli tool:

```yml
build-deps:
  - go
scripts:
  - go build -o example .
mapping:
  example: /usr/bin/example
```
