ðŸ’¾ Single line installation script:

```sh
git clone https://fmnx.io/dev/pack && cd pack && makepkg --noconfirm -sfri
```

### ðŸš€ Features:

- Install and update packages using git links
- Compatability with all arch based distros
- Simple to write configuration - `.pack.yml`

Configuration [example](add_fl_tmp_link) for flutter project:

```yml
# Dependencies, that are required for project at runtime.
run-deps:
  - vlc
# Dependencies, that are required to build project.
build-deps:
  - flutter
  - clang

# Scripts, that would be executed in root directory to get build files.
scripts:
  - flutter build linux
# File mapping for resulting build files and directories from project root
# to resulting file system.
