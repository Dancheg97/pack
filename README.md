> **Warning!** Project is in alpha stage, API's might be changed.

Pack is utility that aims to simplify user interaction with pacman, automate some operations and provide additional functionality for software delivery.

Pack can be used to push your packages to [pacman resgistries](https://fmnx.su/core/registry) and install software from them. You can test it on our [public gitea instance](https://fmnx.su/core/-/packages).

Pack API differs from pacman - it is much smaller. For example, flag `-q`, or `--quick`, can be used as shortcut alternative to `--noconfirm`. Some other flags also might be changed, run `pack -Sh`, `pack -Rh`, `pack -Ph`, `pack -Oh` to get full description for pack commands.

### Installation

Single line installation script for all arch based distributions:

```sh
git clone https://fmnx.su/core/pack && cd pack && makepkg -sfri --needed --noconfirm
```

Alternatively, you can install pack with `go`:

```sh
go install fmnx.su/core/pack
```

---

### Operations

1. Sync packages - operation that you use to install packages to the system. You can mix packages with and without registries in command input. This command will add missing registries to `pacman.conf` and try to syncronize packages with pacman.

```sh
‚ö° Syncronize packages

options:
	-q, --quick       Do not ask for any confirmation (noconfirm shortcut)
	-y, --refresh     Download fresh package databases from the server (-yy force)
	-u, --upgrade     Upgrade installed packages (-uu enables downgrade)
	-f, --force       Reinstall up to date targets

usage:  pack {-S --sync} [options] <(registry)/(owner)/package(s)>
```

2. Push packages - operation that you use to deliver your software to any pack registry (standalone registry or gitea). Registry parameter is required, owner paarameter is optional.

```sh
üöÄ Push packages

options:
        -d, --dir <dir> Use custom source dir with packages (default pacman cache)
        -w, --insecure  Push package over HTTP instead of HTTPS
            --distro    Assign custom distribution in registry (default archlinux)
            --endpoint  Use custom API endpoints rootpath

usage:  pack {-P --push} [options] <registry/(owner)/package(s)>
```

3. Remove packages - this operation will remove packages from system or remote depending on provided arguement. If reigsty and owner are provided, then remote deletion will be executed, otherwise package will be deleted on local system.

```sh
üìç Remove packages

options:
        -o, --confirm  Ask for confirmation when deleting package
        -a, --norecurs Leave package dependencies in the system (removed by default)
        -w, --nocfgs   Leave package configs in the system (removed by default)
            --cascade  Remove packages and all packages that depend on them

usage:  pack {-R --remove} [options] <package(s)>
```

4. Query packages - this command can be executed to get information about local or remote packages. For targets without registry and owner specified local description will be provided, for targets with registry remote information

```sh
```
